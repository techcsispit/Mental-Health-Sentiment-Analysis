## Introduction

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, and understanding the nuances of mental health conditions can be a powerful tool in providing timely support and interventions. This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data to predict the mental health status of individuals based on their statements. By analyzing the language used in these statements, we aim to accurately classify them into one of seven mental health categories: **Normal, Depression, Suicidal, Anxiety, Stress, Bi-Polar, and Personality Disorder**.

As part of "Source Start," an open source event organized by CSI SPIT for 1st and 2nd year students, we invite data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, psychology students, and developers to contribute to this project by improving models, enhancing data preprocessing, adding new features, or optimizing the analysis pipeline.
